# Build a browser game: **EU Tax Tactician**

## Goal

Create a fast, replayable, **educational** web game that helps players learn practical differences in **EU business taxation and incentives** (legally, not evasion). The game should make players better at recognizing which EU country best fits a specific startup scenario.

## Tech & Scope

* Single-page web app (HTML + CSS + Vanilla JS). No backend.
* Mobile-first responsive layout. Works great on desktop too.
* Zero external build tools. All assets local.
* Ship a **self-contained** project with `index.html`, `styles.css`, `game.js`, and a `data/` folder for editable JSON.

## Core Loop / Mechanic

1. **Draw a Scenario Card**: Show a startup idea (industry, size, revenue model, hiring plan, IP, cross-border activity, etc.).
2. **Pick a Country**: Player chooses one EU country from a dropdown or tap a map grid (no actual map library needed—simple grid buttons with flags).
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Show:

   * “Best choice” vs the player’s pick
   * Why the best choice wins for this scenario (1–3 bullet reasons)
   * A short explainer of **relevant legal concepts** (e.g., R&D tax credits, participation exemptions, IP boxes, VAT OSS, withholding on dividends/royalties, loss carryforwards).
4. **Score + Progression**:

   * +100 for correct, +40–90 if close (second-best), 0 otherwise.
   * Speed bonus (timer).
   * **Streak meter** and **rank** (e.g., “Associate → Analyst → Senior → Partner”).
5. **Unlockables (Abilities)**: Grant perks based on performance:

   * **Advisor Hint** (reveal top 2 candidates)
   * **Treaty Tracker** (extra clue on cross-border payments)
   * **R&D Boost** (highlight countries with strong innovation incentives for tech/biotech scenarios)
   * **SME Saver** (highlight regimes friendlier to small, early-profit firms)
6. **Repeat** for N cards. End with final score, breakdown, and “Play Again”.

## Learning Alignment

* Each card teaches **one or two concrete tax concepts** through the rationale.
* Keep numbers qualitative (e.g., “low corporate tax”, “generous R&D credit”)—no need for exact statutory rates.
* Show glossary tooltips for every technical term.

## Game Objective

* Finish a “deck” (e.g., 12 scenarios) with the highest score.
* Encourage replays via **randomized decks** and ability unlock pacing.

## Feedback System

* **Immediate**: After each pick, show:

  * Best country (with flag)
  * 2–4 bullet reasons
  * Short “What you missed” note tied to the scenario’s constraints
* **Cumulative**:

  * End screen with strengths/weaknesses (e.g., “You ace R&D/Innovation incentives. Review VAT distance selling & OSS.”)
  * Show which abilities were unlocked and when.

## Win Conditions

* Clear the deck. Show total score, accuracy %, avg time, longest streak, abilities unlocked. Offer Restart.

## UI/UX Requirements

* Clean, minimal aesthetic (system fonts), big tap targets.
* Three primary views: **Start → Play → Results**.
* Top bar in Play view: Score, Streak, Timer, Ability Buttons (disabled/enabled states).
* Card area: scenario on left (or top on mobile), country grid/dropdown on right (or bottom on mobile).
* Accessibility: keyboard navigable; visible focus rings; ARIA labels.

## Data Architecture (JSON in `/data`)

Create two editable JSON files the game loads:

1. `data/country_traits.json`

* Progress bar for deck completion.

## Disclaimers (visible)

* Banner on Start and in footer:

  > **Educational only.** This game simplifies complex rules. Not legal or tax advice. Laws change—consult a qualified advisor.

## Non-Goals

* No real tax rate tables, no evasion content.

## Implementation Checklist

* [ ] Load JSON files and seed deck randomly.
* [ ] Timer, score, streak, and ability state.
* [ ] Immediate feedback panel with reasons and glossary links.
* [ ] Results analytics and replay.
* [ ] Keyboard navigation & focus states.
* [ ] All strings centralized for easy editing.

**Build this now.**
